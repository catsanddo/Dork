# Overview

I took a dive into the erlang language for this project.
I hoped to learn a bit more about functional programming for it.

I wrote a simple text-based game which makes use of a lot of basic features of the language such as pattern matching, lists, and recursion.

I was able to learn how to adapt problems to fit a functional style approach.

# Development Environment

I used the official erlang runtime for this project.
The only libraries used for all in the standard library.

# Useful Websites

* [learnxinyminutes reference](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/erlang/)
* [Official Stdlib Documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/api-reference.html)

# Future Work

* Allow player to traverse backward through previous chambers
* Create a proper win state
* Check user input properly
